Actual problem:
Role is defined only by the http-request that returns token with a Role
Token is stored in a cookies

Outcomes:
User can change the URL and go to any page but the content is verified by a token

Solution:
Use the "context", that is defined once globally and is used for verification in any component
"context" and "cookie" is set after login(src/components/auth/Logins.js) or registration(src/components/auth/Registration.js)

Questions to ask:
If the user left a page, the "context" is lost. Should the "cookie" store the "context"?
-If yes, how the provider of "context" should get the data from "cookie"?

Done:
-created new folder for a context(src/components/context) + created new file(src/components/context/AuthContext.js)
-cookie functions are taken away in a (src/components/utilities)
